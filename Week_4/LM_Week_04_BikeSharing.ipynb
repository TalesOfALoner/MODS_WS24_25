    "Nowadays Sharing Economies become ever more present, so that for instance people start preferring to flexibly rent a car whenever they need one instead of owning a car which stands still most of the time. This also transfers to services like bike and e-scooter sharing.\n",
    "In this weeks tutorial we will use such a [Bikesharing](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/) dataset and try to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "How strong is the weathers influence on the number of rented bikes?\n",
